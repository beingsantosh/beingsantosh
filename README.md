## Stock Price Prediction

I recently worked on Stock price prediction problem. It was about training the model with the last 10 years news headlines and stock prices. Neural network once trained, are ready for predicting the stock. It used beautifulsoup and selenium for web scrapping, later data was processed with the help of pandas,regex, spacy etc. Modelling was done through LSTM with GloVe embedding. In end, web application was deployed on heroku platform with routing on flask.
